This github repository has been created to upload every project constantly being made for the IoT class/course
of the Electrical and Electronics Engineering , Electronics and Computers Systems class 2023 spring semester.
Additionally IoT projects made for the Arduino Nano RP2040 out of class will be uploaded soon in this repo to 
help with the version control and to keep a track of the process I make throughout the years.
